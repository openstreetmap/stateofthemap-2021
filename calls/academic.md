<h2 id="intro">Academic Track</h2>

This year’s State of the Map conference will feature the fourth edition of the Academic Track - a full day of sessions dedicated to academic research about, and with, OpenStreetMap (for the organisation of last year’s Track, see [here](https://2020.stateofthemap.org/cfp/academic)). These sessions will showcase the research and innovation of scientific investigations into OpenStreetMap. The Academic Track sessions provide a bridge to connect members of the OpenStreetMap community and the academic community through an open passage to exchange ideas, communication and opportunities for increased collaboration. We expect empirical, methodological, conceptual, or literature-review-based contributions addressing any scientific aspect related to OpenStreetMap (OSM), in particular, but not limited to, the following:

  * Extrinsic or intrinsic quality assessment of OpenStreetMap data
  * Analysis of contribution patterns in OpenStreetMap
  * Generation of new and scientifically valuable datasets from OpenStreetMap
  * Assessments of data import procedures and their impacts on data and community
  * Integration between OpenStreetMap and other data sources (authoritative, user-generated, or otherwise valuable to OSM)
  * Analysis/comparison of available software for scientific purposes related to OpenStreetMap
  * New approaches to facilitate or improve data collection and/or data quality in OpenStreetMap (e.g. through gamification or citizen science approaches)
  * Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning and OpenStreetMap (e.g. AI-assisted mapping)
  * Open research problems in OpenStreetMap and challenges for the scientific community
  * Cultural, political, and organizational aspects of data production and usage practices in OpenStreetMap
  * Studies using OpenStreetMap data in scientific domains
  * Reviews of any scientific aspect connected to OpenStreetMap

  In an effort to improve the interaction and collaboration between the academic and the more general OpenStreetMap communities, authors are invited to particularly highlight the practical implications or impacts of their research on the OpenStreetMap community at large.


<h2 id="guidelines">Submission Guidelines</h2>

Authors are invited to submit extended abstracts using the State of the Map 2021 Pretalx [submission system](https://pretalx.com/sotm2021-academic/cfp). Deadline for submission is 25 April 2021.

Abstracts should be between 800 and 1200 words. These limits will be strictly enforced for a fair and balanced review process.

Abstracts must be scientifically rigorous and the content should be logically structured as follows (without the need to include subsections): introduction/background, where the problem addressed is introduced; main aim or purpose of the study; brief description of the methodology and findings achieved; final discussion highlighting the scientific contribution of the study and its practical benefits/implications.

Abstracts are to be submitted online in plain-text format (no images or figures).

Abstracts will be evaluated by the scientific committee. Authors of selected abstracts will be invited to deliver an oral presentation during the Academic Track sessions at the online conference or to present a poster (in case a virtual poster session will be organised). Building on top of the successful [Proceedings of the Academic Track at State of the Map 2019](https://zenodo.org/record/3405431#.XiXKJ3VKgQ8) and [State of the Map 2020](https://zenodo.org/record/3928675#.YFix5ud7lPY), selected abstracts will be published as a collection, each with a distinct Digital Object Identifier (DOI) in [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), an open access online repository.

The 2019 and 2020 Academic Track resulted in a special issue of the [ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijgi) that is now close to [completion](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijgi/special_issues/OpenStreetMap). Similarly, the scientific committee will seek to further disseminate the contributions to this conference by investigating the organization of a special issue in a relevant, open access, scientific journal. Authors of the selected abstracts will be invited to submit a full paper to this special issue. Successful submissions may enjoy partial or full waiver of publication fees.
